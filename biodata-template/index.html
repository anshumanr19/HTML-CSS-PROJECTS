                <b>Haruka Sakura</b> (桜さくら 遥はるか, Sakura Haruka?) is the main protagonist of the WIND BREAKER manga series. He is a first-year student at Furin High School and member of Bofurin's Vaisravana Unit as well as the first year Grade Captain. Constantly judged by his physical appearance, Sakura adopts a delinquent persona that others have projected onto him and moves to Makochi to attend Furin High, an infamously rough school known for its strong guys and delinquents, to fight his way to the top.
